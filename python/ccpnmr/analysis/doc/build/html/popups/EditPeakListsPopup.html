<h1>Peak : Peak Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#peak-peak-lists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Display, Edit and Create Peak Lists</strong></p>
<p>This popup window collects together most of the data that relates to peaks
picked within spectra and how they are organised within peak lists.
Higher-level information that relates to the spectra or the experiments that
generated the data are found elsewhere, in the <a class="reference external" href="EditSpectrumPopup.html">Spectra</a> and <a class="reference external" href="EditExperimentPopup.html">Experiments</a>
tables. Each peak list relates to only one spectrum, but a spectrum can have
multiple peak lists, although most spectra will normally have only one. Having
more than one peak list for a spectrum allows different kinds of peaks to be
separated, for example to distinguish between different peak picking
techniques or real and synthetic peaks.</p>
<p>This popup window is divided into three tab sections. The first shows all of
the peak lists within the current project; the second lists all of the peaks
within a selected list and the third allows the user to make artificial or
synthetic peak lists based upon things like chemical shift values and
coordinate structures.</p>
<p><strong>Peak Lists</strong></p>
<p>This table shows all of the peaks lists within the project, the parameters
that relate directly to them and how they fit with the spectrum/experiment
hierarchy. Each peak list is identified by the experiment and spectrum to
which it belongs, as well as a serial number for the list. Some of the values
in the table may be edited to control a peak list&#8217;s display and behavior. The
most important of these is set in the &#8220;Active?&#8221; column. Each spectrum may have
only one active peak list. The active peak list for a spectrum is the only
peak list that will normally be assigned, have its peak selected in the
spectrum display and will have newly picked peaks added to it. Inactive peak
lists are displayed but do not usually participate in the manipulations that
are done via the spectrum windows.</p>
<p>Each peak list may be displayed in a different style, thus this table allows
the user to change the symbol and colour of the peak list when it is displayed
within spectra. The symbol refers to the cross mark that is placed to indicate
the picked position of the peak; usually an extremum in spectrum intensity.
The colour of the peak list relates to both the colour of the marker symbols
and any textual annotation, e.g. to indicate resonance assignment.</p>
<p>Below the peak list table a few functions that operate on whole peak lists are
available. The [Add Sister List] is notable because it allows the user to make
a new blank peak list, to which new peaks may be copied or added. Here, the
new peak list is added to the same spectrum as the peak list that is currently
selected in the table, hence the use of the word &#8220;Sister&#8221;. The [Copy Peaks] is
used to duplicate peaks, from one peak list to another, assuming the spectrum
dimensions are compatible in terms of isotope types. The [Shift Whole Peak
List] is useful if all of the peaks of a list need to be moved by the same
amount relative to their spectrum. This is useful when peaks are imported with
an offset, e.g. for matching TROSY and non-TROSY peaks, or if spectrum
referencing has changed and peaks have not been properly located.</p>
<p><strong>Peak Table</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind this table is to give a textual listing of all the peaks in
the selected peak list. The user can compare and edit peak parameters, e.g in
terms of assignment or intensity, and can follow links to other kinds of
information. For example the user can go from the selected peaks to the
resonances that are assigned to those peaks. Double-clicking on the editable
columns of the table allows many of the parameters to be directly edited,
although discretion is recommended for certain operations like changing
positions and intensity values. The pulldown menu above the peak table allows
the user to specify which peak list will be displayed. The &#8220;Status&#8221; just below
may be used to show only a subset of peaks, depending on how they are
assigned.</p>
<p>Most of the options above the peak table provide functions that allow the user
to locate and mark peaks within the spectrum display windows. The [Strip
Selected] and [Find Peak] options are used to find particular peaks that have
been selected in the table (with left-click +/- &lt;Ctrl&gt;/&lt;Shift&gt;). The former
sub-divides the locations for separate peaks using strips (window dividers)
and the latter locates only the last selected peak. The [Strip Locations] and
[Go To Position] work in a similar way, except that they use only the
<em>position information</em> from the selected peaks and don&#8217;t necessarily display
the actual selected peaks. The idea here is that peak positions can be used to
move the display of any spectrum window that share at least some of the same
kind of isotopes on their axes. For example a 2D 15N HSQC peak can be used to
find an amide position (H &amp; N) in 3D HNcoCA spectrum, thus locating two out of
three axes. This functionality is very useful when some peak lists are used as
&#8220;roots&#8221; to coordinate others.</p>
<p>The buttons below the main peak table allow the user to edit and view many
types of data associated with the peaks, although many parameters may be
changed by double-clicking in the peak table. Some notable functions include:
[Unalias] which is used to move &#8216;ghost&#8217; peaks to their real underlying ppm
values by adding or subtracting a whole number of spectrum widths to their
position. This is used when a peak lies outside the normal recorded bounds of
the spectrum but nonetheless still appears within it because as an aliased
signal;  [Assign] opens the <a class="reference external" href="EditAssignmentPopup.html">Assignment Panel</a> to control which resonances
have been linked to the dimensions of the peak; to indicate what caused the
peak. Such assignments may be to the resonances of specific atoms or
resonances that are currently anonymous;  [Deassign] clears all of the
resonance assignments to the peak dimensions. This does not affect how the
resonances may be connected to atoms;  [Set Details] allows the user to set
the &#8220;Details&#8221; column for all of the peaks selected in the table with a single
operation; [Propagate Assign] spreads resonance assignments from one peak (the
last selected) to the others selected in the table, which is useful even if
not all of the peak dimensions are the same type, for example when spreading
amide H &amp; N resonances from an HSQC peak to 3D triple-resonance peaks.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Lists</strong></p>
<p>The final tab is used to make new peak lists where peak entities are predicted
by artificial or synthetic means, i.e. not by direct inspection of spectrum
intensities. If possible, peaks that are created by one of the synthetic
methods and which are used as a source of evidence for NMR derived information
should ultimately be related to the spectrum data; by re-centering the peaks
and re-calculating their intensities. Four methods are currently available for
synthesising new peak lists:</p>
<p>The &#8220;From Shift Intersections&#8221; section allows the user to make a peak list
based upon the intersection between chemical shifts that occur within the
bounds of a given spectrum (the same spectrum that the peak list will belong
to). A shift list is selected to specify which chemical shift values are used,
and by default this shift list is the one that the spectrum uses during
assignment (set at the experiment level). The synthesised peaks will correspond
to all chemical shift values that match the spectrum data dimensions, in terms
of isotope, and fit together to give a complete peak assignment. This shift
matching process also considers whether the spectrum data dimensions represent
only atom sites that are directly bound; thus removing many spurious peak
locations. For example a 15N HSQC peak list may be made from 1H and 15N
resonances that lie along the two  spectrum axes of the resonances and are
covalently bound to one another. The through-space options control how far
predictions are made for transfers like NOESY, i.e. in the absence of a
structure you can limit the number of bonds and/or number of sequential
residues to consider. It should be noted that this system cannot predict peaks
for all kinds of spectra. It is currently limited to those kinds of experiment
where all magnetisation transfers go through atom sites that are either
recorded directly as a spectrum dimension (e.g. in HNCA, HH NOESY) or are
intermediate between two recorded dimensions (e.g. HN(co)CA) and linked via
J-coupling or one-bond transfer. More kinds of peak list may be predicted in
the future. It is notable that for NOESY peak lists only peaks that represent
connections between atoms that are either in the same residue or within five
covalent bonds of one another are used.</p>
<p>The &#8220;For Shifts and Structure&#8221; section makes synthetic peak lists using
chemical shift intersections, as described above, but only allowing spectra
that have a through-space connectivity (e.g. NOESY) between two of their
dimensions. Also when comparing through-space connections, the possible peaks
are filtered according to how close assigned atoms are within a structure
ensemble. Any peaks that would be assigned to pairs of atoms that are further
apart than the &#8220;Max Dist&#8221; value will not be made. The user can also reject
certain peaks by insisting on a minimum spectrum intensity value at its
position.</p>
<p>The &#8220;From Transposition&#8221; section is used to make peaks based upon reflection
about a homonuclear diagonal. For example if peaks have been picked on only
one side of a 2D NOESY experiment&#8217;s diagonal, corresponding duplicates may be
made on the other side of the diagonal where the assignments and positions of
the two dimensions are swapped. Naturally, this functionality is limited to
only spectra that have two data dimensions with of the same isotope type.</p>
<p>The &#8220;From Distance Restraints&#8221; section is used to recreate NOE and other
through-space peak lists based upon distance restraints, which may have been
imported from outside CCPN. The individual distance restrains provide a list
of atom pairs that are known to be close. The peaks are then synthesised from
those by obtaining the chemical shift of the atom&#8217;s resonances. Where
relevant, the chemical shift of any covalently bound resonances are also
obtained. The chemical shifts are then matched within the bounds of the
selected spectrum, considering whether any of the data dimensions represent a
&#8216;onebond&#8217; relationship that much be preserved in the peak assignments. It
should be noted that a single distance restraint may give rise to more than
one peak, when it is not possible to determine which restrained atom goes on
which spectrum dimension. Also, ambiguous distance restraints will give rise
to ambiguous peak assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>If you need the peak positions to be displayed in Hz units or as data point
positions, the &#8220;Position Unit&#8221; pulldown at the top may be changed.</p>
<p>The [Set Details] function can be handy for marking peaks that cause violations
in a structure calculation and thus need further attention.</p>
<p>Peak lists may be merged by copying the peaks from one into another, although
this takes no account of duplication.</p>
<p>When making synthetic NOESY (or other though-space) peaks, having a residue
limit of 1 or 2 will naturally not have an effect if the bond limit is too
short, i.e. where the wouldn&#8217;t be enough bonds to get to the next residues.</p>
