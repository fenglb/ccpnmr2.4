<h1>Structure : Make Distance Restraints<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-make-distance-restraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Create Structural Distance Restraints From NMR Peaks</strong></p>
<p>This system is used to make resonance to resonance distance restraints based
on peak intensity information from through-space NMR experiments, such as
NOESY. Three mechanisms are available with regard to the assignment of
resonance pairs to individual restraints, but for all three methods the
distance information is extracted from peak intensities in the same way.  The
use of peak intensities and the three restraint generation methods are
described below.</p>
<p><strong>Restraint Distance Estimation</strong></p>
<p>The options available in the &#8220;Restraint Distance Params section&#8221; if the
&#8220;Settings&#8221; tab allow the user to specify how through-space peak intensities
relate to the distance bounds of any any generated distance restraints. The
default method is to calculate a target distance as peak height raised to the
power of -1/6 multiplied by some scaling factor. However the user may also use
peak volumes by changing the &#8220;Intensity Type&#8221; and other power relations
via the &#8220;Distance function&#8221; pulldown menu.</p>
<p>The peak intensity scaling factor is defined such that the reference intensity
(defaults to the peak list&#8217;s average volume) exactly corresponds to the
reference distance (default 3.2 Angstroms). The user may change either of
these values to calibrate in a different way. For example by measuring the
peak intensities of known atomic distances such as those in an aromatic ring.
The default values are appropriate for most protein structure calculations
based on NOESY experiments, and in any case structure calculation programs
like ARIA and CYANA will normally re-calibrate peak intensity scaling during
the structure generation process. Hence, the initial calibration is not too
critical; covalent geometry will provide better global calibration.</p>
<p>The upper and lower bounds of the distance restraints are calculated as
fractional differences from the calculated target distance. For example if a
target distance is 3.2 Angstroms an upper fractional error of 0.20 gives an
upper limit of 3.84 (20% more) and 0.2 lower fractional error gives a lower
limit of 2.56 (20% less). The upper and lower bounds are also confined the
upper and lower distance limits. These are absolute minimum and maximum values
for the bounds (1.72 &amp; 8.00 Angstroms respectively by default).</p>
<p>If none of the fractional power distance functions are appropriate for the NMR
data then the user may select the &#8220;Distance Bins&#8221; option. Here the user
defines peak intensity classes, each of which relates to a target distance and
distance bounds. Each class has a &#8220;Min. Peak Intensity&#8221; value, which is a
multiplying factor relative to the reference intensity (by default the peak
list mean). When Analysis determines which distance class to use for a peak it
first divides its intensity value by the reference intensity to get a relative
value, then the distance classes are searched for the class with the largest
&#8220;Min. Peak Intensity&#8221; that is below the peak&#8217;s relative intensity. For
example with two classes defined at 0.0 and 1.0 minimum intensities, a peak
with a relative intensity value of 0.5 would fall in the first class, and a
peak with 1.2 would fall in the second.</p>
<p><strong>Restraints From Fully Assigned Peaks</strong></p>
<p>The simplest way of generating distance restraints from through-space NMR
experiments is to use the spectrum peaks that have been fully assigned. If a
peak is caused by correlation between resonances and the atomic identities of
those causal resonances is known (or at least suspected) a distance restraint
can be created from the peak information. In CCPN terms the restraint will be
between the resonances that are assigned to the through-space correlated peak
dimensions, but only if those resonances are assigned to particular atoms (in
a molecular system). Restraints are made for assigned peaks by selecting an
appropriate peak list in the pulldown menu, at the very top of the popup,
above the tabs, and pressing the [Make Assigned Restraints] at the bottom.
Naturally, the user should make sure that parameters are specified for
distance estimation and residue ranges and that the correct restraint set is
selected in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab, to say where the generated restraint list
should be placed.</p>
<p>Restraints will be generated for peaks that carry multiple, ambiguous
assignments. This happens where the observed peak in a spectrum covers
multiple resonance intersections that are unresolvable due to the relative
scale of linewidths compared to the similarity of chemical shifts. In such
circumstances all of the resonances assigned to the peaks through-space
correlated dimensions will appear in the restraint. By default, if a peak is
assigned to resonances A &amp; B in one dimension and C &amp; D on the other then an
ambiguous restraint will be generated with items for all four resonance pairs;
A-C, A-D, B-C and B-D, and a restraint would be satisfied by any of these
pairs being within distance bounds. However, if the user knows that only
certain pairings are possible on an ambiguously assigned peak then the
assignments may be grouped via the <a class="reference external" href="EditAssignmentPopup.html">Assignment Panel</a>. Referring to the
previous example if resonance A &amp; C are in group 1 and B &amp; D are in group 2
then the generated restraint will only have two items; A-C and B-D.</p>
<p><strong>Restraints From Matching Chemical Shifts</strong></p>
<p>There is a second common way to generate distance restraints, which is to
match the chemical shifts of resonances to unassigned peak positions, thus
generating potentially highly ambiguous distance restraints. Such restraints
would typically be filtered to select only the correct contributing resonance
pairs, by iterative structure generation and violation analysis in a program
like ARIA or CYANA. Often the user can leave the matching of chemical shifts
to the structure generation program, by passing the program peak lists rather
than restraint lists. However, it is also possible to make such restraints in
CCPN.  The [Make Shift Match Restraints] can be used to generate restraints
for the unassigned peaks in the selected peak list, however the user should be
aware of all of the parameters that will be applied, including the &#8220;Shift
Match Tolerances&#8221;, &#8220;Residue Ranges&#8221; and &#8220;Chem Shift Ranges&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Shift Match Tolerances&#8221; tab is important because it specifies how the
matching is done between (unassigned) peak positions and resonances with known
chemical shifts. In essence, every unassigned peak dimension is compared to
the chemical shifts contained within the shift list that is associated  with
the NMR experiment from which the peak derive. The shift list that relates to
an experiment, and hence to a peak list, may be adjusted in the main
<a class="reference external" href="EditExperimentPopup.html">Experiments</a> table. Resonances whose shifts are close to the peak position may
be the cause of that peak and so can be used to make a restraint. Often
several resonances will match in each peak dimension, resulting in a restraint
with many alternative, ambiguous resonance pairings (restraint &#8220;items&#8221;). The
incorrect possibilities may be removed by automated structure generation
programs, which generate guide structures based on the unambiguous restraints.
The &#8221;... PPM tolerance&#8221; values are used to control the maximum allowed
difference from a peak location to a chemical shift for a resonance to be
considered as an assignment possibility; the threshold width of the shift
matching. In the absence of linewidth information only the &#8220;Min/default PPM
tolerance&#8221; is used. If a peak has a recorded linewidth then its value may be
used to scale the shift-match threshold, i.e. wider peaks match a wider PPM
range. In such cases the shift-match threshold is the peak&#8217;s linewidth
multiplied by the &#8220;line width multiplier&#8221; value, but bounded by the minimum
and maximum PPM tolerance values.</p>
<p>The [Test Shift Match] function can be used to trail the peak to resonance
matching procedure without generating any distance restraints. This is useful
to test how many peaks would fail to be matched, and the resonance why.</p>
<p>When shift-match restraints are made the resonance matches can be filtered by
using a guide structure (e.g. homologue or rough structure) with a
corresponding distance cutoff, so that resonance pairs that are far apart  in
the guide will not be places in the restraints. Also, shift matching obeys any
isotope labelling scheme setting; any resonance pair that has a spin-active
isotope incorporation below the &#8220;Minimum Isotope Fraction&#8221; is deemed not to be
visible and will not be present in a restraint.</p>
<p><strong>Network Anchoring</strong></p>
<p>In the case of the shift-matching method potentially ambiguous distance
restraints are generated by simply matching peak positions to close chemical
shifts. In the case of network anchoring method, chemical shifts are also
matched to peaks, but the ambiguous possibilities are refined by selecting
only NOE assignments from amongst the possibilities that are supported by
other known close resonances or covalent structure. Say, for example, that a
peak could have arisen from a number of resonance pairs with matching shifts.
Two resonances A &amp; B are more likely to be a correct assignment for the peak
if we know that they are close to (or bound to) the same intermediary
resonance, C and therefore must be close to each other.</p>
<p>The network anchoring procedure is directed using the &#8220;Network Anchoring&#8221; tab
and   operates over several peak lists at the same time. These peak lists are
selected in the &#8220;Peak List Selection&#8221; table by double clicking in the &#8220;Use?&#8221;
column to indicate &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Any assigned peaks in these peak lists, together
with the covalent connectivity of the atoms, will form the initial
through-space network. The restraint generation occurs after the iterative
network refinement process converges (usually in fewer than five cycles). The
parameters for the refinement are specified above the main table. It should be
noted that only a shift list and set of shift match tolerances is currently
used.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Min net. score&#8221; is used during refinement to dictate how much network
support an assignment possibility must have for it to be included. Setting
this to a higher value will mean fewer mistakes are made but at the expense of
making fewer restraints. The &#8220;Strictness&#8221; setting relates to which residues
may be involved in the local network to help resolve restraint possibilities.
Considering only connections within a single residue makes few mistakes but
doesn&#8217;t resolve much of the ambiguity. Using any residue makes most mistakes
but most restraints. The default &#8220;Normal: Sequential residue support&#8221;
is a useful compromise between these two extremes.</p>
<p><strong>Residue and Chemical Shift Ranges</strong></p>
<p>The &#8220;Residue Ranges&#8221; section is used to restrict the restraint generation to
only specific regions of a molecular system.  For example, this is useful if a
protein is known to have an unstructured tail and the chemical shifts from
this should not be considered because they would add unnecessary ambiguity. A
residue range applies to one molecular chain and the peak dimensions on one
side of a through-space correlation. This means that different dimensions can
be restricted to different bits of a molecular system; useful with X-filtered
NMR experiments. Residue ranges are applied to all forms of restraint
generation, i.e. for assigned peaks, shift matching and network anchoring.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Chem Shift Ranges&#8221; tab is used to allow or disallow certain resonance
signals from being used in the shift matching and network anchoring restraint
generation. Different allowed ranges can be specified for each spectrum
dimension (of the selected peak list) and a single dimension can have multiple
ranges. In this way the user can control whether certain kind of resonances
with distinct shifts are used, e.g. methyls. Often a &#8216;water notch&#8217; is used,
where two ranges with a small gap between are constructed to exclude peaks
near the chemical shift of water; such peaks do not related to close macromolecule
distances.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>Restraints are always made in a restraint list that is placed in the selected
restraint set. By default a new restraint set is made, thus to  make restraint
lists that go together in an existing set the right  one must be selected in
the &#8220;Settings Tab&#8221;.</p>
<p>A new restraint set should always be used if any resonance to atom assignments
have been changed, otherwise new restraints will still obey the original
&#8220;fixed&#8221; assignments that were present in the old restraint set, not the new
ones.</p>
