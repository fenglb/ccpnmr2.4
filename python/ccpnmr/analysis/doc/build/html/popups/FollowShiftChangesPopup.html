<h1>Data Analysis : Follow Shift Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#data-analysis-follow-shift-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Follow Chemical Shift Changes During Titrations</strong></p>
<p>This system is desined to efficently extract changing peak position data,
which for example may occur during a titration experiment, and then fit the
chemical shift changes to an equation curve for the extraction of parameters
that relate to the peak movements. This analysis may be used to measure such
things as dissociation constants (e.g. Kd) and temperature coeffients; where
the position of or more peaks in a group  of related spectra changes according
to some experimental condition. Many kinds of experimental condition may be
varied, but series with changing in concentration (e.g. ligand), temperature
or pH are commonplace. This system is closely related to the <a class="reference external" href="CalcRatesPopup.html">Follow Intensity
Changes</a> tool, but here the peak grouping and function fitting is for peak
locations that do move, rather than stay in the same place and change
intensity.</p>
<p>The general idea is that the user sets up an &#8220;NMR series&#8221; that contains an
array of experiments where each experiment is point in the series and
represents a different value for a parameter (like concentration) being
investigated. Based initially on the reference peak positions, trajectories
where picked peak positions move in the different experiments are tracked by
finding the peak groups that best fits the stated function which relates
chemical shift to series parameter. It should be noted that NMR series that
are comprised of experiment planes stacked into a higher-dimensionality
&#8220;pseudo-nD&#8221; experiment cannot be used in this analysis. The reason for this
relates to the way that experiments link to chemical shift lists in the CCPN
data model; there is no meachanism to record a changing chemical shift within
a single experiment.</p>
<p>The layout of the popup window is split into two tabs to reduce clutter. The
first tab allows the user to setup and adjust all of the options used to
follow the peak positions as they form &#8220;trajectories&#8221; and do the function
fitting. The second tab is used to display the results on a table of peak
groups, where each group corresponds to a series of peaks which have common
assignemnts, with one peak for each experiment.</p>
<p>The general idea is that the user selects a reference peak list, which will
give assignment identities to the peak groups being analysed. Typically the
reference peak list will be from an experiment <em>in the NMR series</em>, so that
the the positions of the peaks, as they move in the different experiments,
cross or end at the reference position. For proteins this reference will often
be a 15N HSQC peak list, in which case the analysis operates on peak groups
that correspond to amides of individual residues.</p>
<p>The user chooses an NMR series that has been setup in the <a class="reference external" href="EditExperimentSeriesPopup.html">NMR Series</a> popup,
accessible using the [Edit NMR Series] button. For the anlysis to proceed
properly the selected NMR series will need to contain all of the experiments
that form part of the titration/analysis and the vaues of the condition being
studied (e.g. concentration) must be correctly set. The &#8220;Data List Type&#8221; and
corresponding unit indicate what kind of experimental condition/parameter, as
dictated by the NMR series, will be fitted to chemical shift distance. The
&#8220;Fitting Function&#8221; option is adjusted to say what kind of curve should be
fitted to the peak intensity data; the linear &#8220;Ax + B&#8221; is common for
temperature coefficents while the elaborate &#8220;A((B+4x-sqrt((B+4x)^2-(4x)^2))/4x
- C)&#8221; is often used to measure dissociation constants. The Error Method
determines how the errors in the parameters of the fitted function (e.g. error
in Kd rate) will be calculated.</p>
<p>The &#8220;covariance&#8221; error method can be used if the measurement errors are
normally distributed (which is often a reasonable assumption).  For each
parameter the error (standard deviation) estimate is the square root of
(the chi squared value times the covariance matrix diagonal term for that
parameter).
Reference: section 15.6, &#8220;Confidence Limits on Estimated Model Parameters&#8221;
in Numerical Recipes, second edition.</p>
<p>The &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; error method uses repeated sampling to provide an estimate
of the error.  If there are N (x, y) points to be fit then each sampling
takes N of those (x, y), but with replacement allowed, so some of the (x, y)
might be repeated and some might be left out.  For each sampling the best
fit is calculated and that determines the parameters for this specific
sampling, which in turn allows an estimate of the error (standard deviation)
over all samplings.  Analysis uses 1000 samples.
Reference: &#8220;Bootstrap Methods for Standard Errors, Confidence Intervals and
Other Measures of Statistical Accuracy&#8221;, B. Efron and R. Tibshirani,
Statistical Science, 1986, Vol. 1, No. 1, 54-77.</p>
<p>The &#8220;jiggling&#8221; error method uses repeated sampling but here the (x, y) are
both sampled from a normal distribution with mean the actual value and
standard deviation the estimated data errors.  There is no real scientific
basis for this estimate, so probably best avoided.</p>
<p>The peak groups that are analysed for the fit of experimental parameter to
chemical shift distance may be manually specified by giving a common
assignment to peaks that derive from the same resonances. Alternatively, an
automatic method is used to find peaks which are not assigned. This automation
follows the positions of peaks in their trajectories, choosing the best
combination of peaks that a) roughly follows a straight line and b) fits the
selected fuction equation, in terms of the expected chemical shift distance
for the experiment. Having the &#8220;Assign groups?&#8221; option set means that after
the first peak grouping, peaks will be linked via assignment and subsequent
peak searches are not generally required. Peak positions may be tracked in one
or more spectrum dimensions, according to the &#8220;Followed Dimensions&#8221; selection.
When multiple dimensions are used, chemical shift difference for dissimilar
istopes are combined using the &#8220;Shift Weighting&#8221; values. The &#8220;Max Step Size&#8221;
value are important for the automated peak grouping, given that they limit
which peaks are considered when going from one experiment to the next. When
step sizes are too large the grouping calculation can take a long time. When
step sizes are too small peaks will be missed and grouping may fail.</p>
<p>The peak grouping and function fitting is performed using the [Group &amp; Fit
Peaks] function. After the initial grouping the curve fitting may be
redone with via one of the &#8220;Re-fit&#8221; buttons; this useful if the fitting
function is changed. When the curve fitting is done the parameter results from
the fit, e.g. the &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; from an &#8220;Ax + B&#8221; equation, are immediately
made available from the results table. Also, where relevant, any Kd values are also presented; this requires that the
binding site concentration was specified. In the &#8220;Peak Groups &amp; Analysis&#8221;
table the user can see the fit results and analyse or adjust the peak groups.
It is commonplace to look through all the intensity curves for each of the
peak groups by using [Show Fit Graph]; here the user can check how well the
curve-fit worked and whether any adjustments (e.g. in peak picking) need to be
made or groups removed. See the <a class="reference external" href="EditFitGraphPopup.html">Fit Graph</a> documentation for details about
how the resultant popup window operates. The &#8220;Y&#8221; value of the curves come
from the (isotope weigted) chemical shift distance for each peak of the group
<em>along the trajectory from its start point</em> and the &#8220;X&#8221; values come from those
that were entered for the experimental points/planes in the NMR series. When
the results have been checked, they may be used by directly  exporting the
fitted parameters from the table.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>Each peak group need not contain the same number of peaks if data is missing.</p>
<p>Peaks must be picked in all of the analysed experiments beforehand for this
system to function.</p>
<p>Choosing an assigned reference peak list that is postioned in the centre of the
moving peak trajectories will give the quickest and most reliable peak
groupings; the trajectory search radius is minimised.</p>
<p>If there are problems with grouping peaks together the user may assign all
peaks that ought to go in the same group to the same resonances, for example
using the &#8220;propagate&#8221; assignment option, thus connecting peaks together.</p>
<p>It is expected that each experiment of the analysed series, because peaks move
position significantly, will be linked to a separate chemical shift record; so
that there is a shift value for each condition point. If the experiments of a
series do no not use separate shift list the user will be propted to set this
up.</p>
<p>For groups where the peaks do not move significantly, between experiments in
the series, a curve will still be fitted to the trajectory. This is because
the value fitted is a weighted chemical shift distance, from one position to
the next in the trajectory, and distances will always be positive, including
when points double-black (within the &#8220;Shift Error&#8221; tolerance).</p>
<p>If the peak grouping is taking a significant amount of time, consider reducing
the &#8220;Max Step Size&#8221; values; but still leave vales large enough to jump from
one experiment to the next.</p>
<p>The fit of the equation curve to the chemical shift changes is naturally
limited to how many experimental points there are in the series and how well
spread they are. For example when measuring ligand Kd values, where possible,
if is best to have some experiments at low concentration and some at high
concentration, near saturation.</p>
<p>A subset of peaks in a series may be analysed by reducing the number of peaks
in the reference peak list. For example the user could make a copy of an HSQC
peak list and then remove and peak locations that are not required in the
analysis, e.g. for side chain NH2 peaks or for resonance which don&#8217;t move
significantly enough for analysis.</p>
