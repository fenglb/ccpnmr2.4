<h1>Experiment : Spectra<a class="headerlink" href="#experiment-spectra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Curate Spectrum Parameters</strong></p>
<p>This popup window allows the user to view and edit information that is
associated with spectra. In this regard a spectrum is a record of the NMR data
that was <em>obtained</em>. Parameters that relate to what was <em>done experimentally</em>
to get the data are specified elsewhere; experiment level information is set
via the main <a class="reference external" href="EditExperimentPopup.html">Experiments</a>  popup window. Many spectrum level parameters in
Analysis relate to how the spectrum data files are interpreted and displayed
graphically, i.e. as contours. Data that derive from the analysis of spectra,
like peak lists and assignments, are managed elsewhere in specialised
displays.</p>
<p>The layout of this popup window involves several tab panels that sub-divide
the spectrum settings into related groups. The functionality within each
tabbed sub-division is largely independent, although a spectrum entity
selected in any of the tables or pulldown menus is subject to the [Delete
Spectrum] function.</p>
<p><strong>Main &#8220;Spectra&#8221; tab</strong></p>
<p>This table presents an overview of all of the spectra that have been loaded
into the CCPN project, what their dimensions are and how they relate to
experiments and peak lists. Some of the parameters may be edited by
double-clicking on a cell in the table, thus for example the user may change
the name and set the active peak list (the one that is used for peak peaking
and selection). In the main however, this table usually serves simply to
illustrate what is present, which experiment each spectrum belongs to and
what its NMR dimensions are.</p>
<p><strong>Display Options</strong></p>
<p>This table is used to control how spectra are visualised within the spectrum
window displays of Analysis. Specifically, the user can: change the colours
of the displayed contours and 1D slice traces; get access to the contour
level settings, via the <a class="reference external" href="EditContourLevelsPopup.html">Spectrum Contour Levels</a> tool; access the <a class="reference external" href="EditContourFilesPopup.html">Spectrum
Contour Files</a> setup; set keyboard toggles; and administer other graphical
elements like bounding box lines, peak fonts and peak pointer lines. It
should be noted that the colours for peak text and peak symbols are set for
individual peak lists, so that different peak lists within the same spectrum
may be distinguished. Accordingly these parameters are set via the main
<a class="reference external" href="EditPeakListsPopup.html">Peak Lists</a> option.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Rank&#8221; value of a spectrum dictates the order in which spectra are drawn
on screen and presented in the toggle options at the top of spectrum windows.
The rank may be set on an individual basis or following the order of spectra
in the table using [Set Ranks From Order]; this is especially useful if the
table is first sorted in a particular way (by clicking on a table heading).</p>
<p><strong>Referencing</strong></p>
<p>This table is used to control how the points in a spectrum data file are
interpreted in terms of NMR frequency, on each of their axes. Usually, this
means to know how positions in the spectrum data, stored as an array of
intensity data points, relate to ppm units and Hz frequency values of the
spectrometer. Such referencing occurs by specifying how the width of a
spectrum dimension in data points relates to its width in frequency units,
defining the scaling factor, and how the two scales are anchored together; by
giving a reference data point and its corresponding a frequency/ppm value.</p>
<p>The spectrum referencing values are normally extracted from the spectrum
header or parameter file when the spectrum was first loaded. Often these
values do not need to be altered. However, the user may still adjust all of
the parameters after load time, with the sole exception of the dimensions
isotope type. Changes to spectrum referencing may be made after loading to
correct for mistakes in the initial data interpretation and to tweak spectra
so that they give a better overlay of signals. Note that the table columns
&#8216;Spectrometer Frequency&#8217;, &#8216;Minimum Aliased Frequency&#8217;, &#8216;Maximum aliased
frequency&#8217;, and &#8216;Sub Dim Name&#8217; (normally hidden) apply to the experiment, and
will are shared between all spectra in the same experiment.</p>
<p>Peaks that are picked within spectra have positions defined in terms of
spectrum data points, i.e. normally indicating an extremum in intensity. The
referencing values of a spectrum&#8217;s dimensions are used to calculate what the
position of a peak is in ppm or Hz units. Accordingly, if spectrum
referencing values are changed then peak ppm locations will naturally move.
If peaks should not move with the spectrum data when referencing is changed,
to instead stay at the same ppm values, then the user can select &#8220;ppm&#8221; in the
&#8220;reference changes keep constant peak:&#8221; options.</p>
<p>Some less common experiments have more than one type of signal (shift) on
each axis, and need a reference line to describe each experiment type. One
obvious case is projection experiments, where signals in one dimension are
linear combinations of frequencies for different nuclei. Another would be the
15N/13C HSQC-NOESY, where 15N and 13C are measured in parallel on one axis.
The special options for this situation are turned on by selecting  &#8216;Use
reduced dimensionality options&#8217;. The individual reference lines are called
&#8216;Sub-dimensions&#8217;; they are shown explicitly when there is more than one. They
can be added, removed, and edited individually. The Sub-dimensions set for the
first Spectrum serve to (re)define those for the Experiment; once there is
more than one Spectrum in an Experiment it is not possible to add extra
Sub-dimensions. Projection spectra can only be read correctly from some
formats (Bruker and USF3) and even these cases may require editing. The
special &#8216;Sub Dim Name&#8217; column gives a name that is used by some external
programs (e.g. Prodecomp) to identify a given signal type across different
experiments. The special &#8216;Scaling Factors&#8217; column gives the scaling
coefficient that applies to a particular signal in this spectrum. For instance
scaling factors  CO:1; CA:0; CB:-2 would denote a signal of the form wN-2wCB.
There can be more than one scaling factor where different types of peaks are
possible, e.g. wN OR wC. The system has only been tested for 2D projection
spectra.</p>
<p>The minimum and maximum aliased frequency values for a spectrum dimension, as
displayed in the last columns of the table, may be set to cut off the
spectrum contour display at a particular value or extend the contour display.
Contour displays that are extended beyond the normal sweep width (ppm range)
of the spectrum do so by tiling; a copy of the contours (not mirror image) is
made and placed next to the normal, fundamental region. This mechanism is
used to cope with aliased resonances that appear (as &#8216;ghost&#8217; peak images)
within the main spectrum width in places that are not their true ppm values;
the resonance is really outside the sweep width of the spectrum. Making tiled
copies of the contours allows the spectrum to extend and cover the real ppm
values of aliased peaks. Aliased peaks may be moved to their true ppm
locations or picked at that location in the first instance by using the
appropriate tile region.</p>
<p><strong>Tolerances</strong></p>
<p>This section is used to control the weightings and tolerances that apply to
individual spectrum dimensions during the resonance assignment process. There
are two kinds of value that can be set. One is the &#8220;Assignment Tolerance&#8221;,
which states how close (typically in ppm) chemical shift values of resonances
match to peak peak locations; this is an upper limit such that resonances
with shifts outside the tolerance are not considered as assignment
possibilities. The second thing is the &#8220;Shift Weighting&#8221; that specifies how
much influence resonance assignments have on the averaged chemical shift
values. Both of these parameters affect individual spectrum dimensions
because each axis has is its own resonance line shape and data resolution.</p>
<p>The normal chemical shift calculation within Analysis calculates values as
the weighted mean over all of the peak positions to which a resonance is
assigned. If a dimension has a shift weighting of 2.0 but others have 1.0
then any resonance assignment in the former will have twice as much influence
on the shift mean, as if it were assigned to two peak dimensions rather than
one. By default all weights are set to 1.0, but the user can increase this if
a spectrum dimension is particularly precise (narrow peaks) or decrease it if
peaks are broad or if resonance assignments are highly ambiguous; for
speculative NOE assignments the user usually doesn&#8217;t want the shift values to
change according to those assignments.</p>
<p>The assignment tolerance and shift weighting values are set for the
dimensions of a selected spectrum in the upper table. The lower &#8220;Spectrum
Overview&#8221; table shows these values across all spectra in the project, so that
the user can see the overall situation and range of values. Although
tolerances are not set in the lower table on an individual basis, the
assignment tolerances and shift weights can be spread from one spectrum (the
last selected) to any others selected in the table (using left-click + &lt;Crtl&gt;
or &lt;Shift), where the isotopes of dimensions match.</p>
<p><strong>File Details</strong></p>
<p>This tab is used to indicate the location of a spectrum&#8217;s binary data file
and how the binary data within is read. In essence the binary values of the
file need to be interpreted as spectrum intensity values, but in order to do
this the system has to know how the numbers are stored. This involves knowing
how numbers are represented per se; how many bytes a number uses, whether
numbers are integers or floating point and what orientation the bits are in
(big or little endian). Also, most spectrum data formats involve binary
blocks; chunks of data organised into a grid across all the dimensions. The
benefit of using blocks comes when looking at large data sets, e.g. using 3D
and higher dimensionality data, because it means that when only looking at a
sub-region of a spectrum, like a single plane of a 3D, only part of the
spectrum data needs to be read; most of the spectrum data that isn&#8217;t
displayed does not need to be loaded. Naturally, the system needs to know
what the sizes of the data block along each dimension are. These are
displayed in the lower table and may be adjusted if there are any mistakes,
which may have been inherited from the spectrum processing.</p>
<p>The &#8220;File name&#8221; field shows the present location of the binary data. If this
file is missing the spectrum will still be represented in Analysis, but the
operations which rely of having intensity data, like picking peaks, cannot be
performed. It is notable that the binary data file for a spectrum can be
changed at any time, either by selecting a different file name (typing
directly or using [Choose File]) or by directly replacing the binary data
inside the file. If the binary data or any of the parameters that influence
its interpretation has changed, then the user can click on [Refresh Spectrum]
to see the effect if the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Locations</strong></p>
<p>This last table is used to show the locations of all of the spectrum data
files used by the whole project. These locations need to be changed if the
spectrum data is moved in disk, otherwise the system will not know where to
look. Each data location is broken down into two components; an &#8220;absolute&#8221;
directory path and a &#8220;relative&#8221; path, which contains the file name. Both of
these components may be changed.</p>
<p>The absolute part of the location is from the root of the file system (the
all-encompassing directory) and is often shared by several spectrum files; it
is typical to store spectra in one repository. For convenience, changing the
absolute part of the path for one spectrum will usually change the value for
all the other spectra that use the same directory. Also, if multiple files
are moved to the same directory then [Propagate Absolute Path] can be used to
state that several files are in the same location.</p>
<p>The relative part of the spectrum data path is individual to the spectrum and
contains the name of the data file and any extra directory location, relative
to the absolute part of the path. Which parts of the spectrum file path is
considered to be absolute or relative may be changed using the &#8220;Shift
Directory...&#8221; buttons. For example an absolute : relative split of
&#8220;/data/spectra/&#8221; : &#8220;protein/123.spec&#8221; can be changed to
&#8220;/data/spectra/protein&#8221; : &#8220;123.spec&#8221;, so that several spectra can use the
absolute part.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>The spectrum chemical shift weighting used for synthetic peak lists is set to
0.0001 of the the regular weighting for the spectrum dimension set via this
popup.</p>
<p>The fonts used for the printing of spectra (e.g. via PostScript of PDF) may
be set separately to the main spectrum font specification, which is used
within Analysis spectrum displays.</p>
