<h1>Molecule : Molecules<a class="headerlink" href="#molecule-molecules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Define Molecular Information in a CCPN Project</strong></p>
<p>This popup window is used to setup all of the molecular information that will
be used in a CCPN project. Naturally, the objective is to define the
molecular entities that were present in the sample when an NMR experiment
was run so that the resonances that appear in the resulting spectra can
be ascribed to particular atoms, residues and polymer chains.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Elements &amp; Compounds</strong></p>
<p>In general this system is concerned with several different concepts which
combine to give the final molecular description. The first concept is that of
the reference information that relates to chemical elements and chemical
compounds. As far as the user is concerned this kind of information is mostly
fixed; there should be only one invariant definition of of the element carbon
or the amino acid histidine for example. A chemical compound in this respect
contains a description of a group of atoms and how they are bound together, and
also lists the different forms that the compound will take, like protonation
states. For a given type of molecule (protein, DNA, RNA etc) a chemical
compound will be identified by a residue code name, e.g. histidine is &#8220;His&#8221;. In
CCPN this name is usually referred to as the &#8220;Ccp code&#8221;, and is often, but not
always three letters. The common biological residues will also have a
one-letter code, e.g. histidine is &#8220;H&#8221;, that may be used in some
circumstances. Defining the sequence of a biopolymer with residue code names,
or letters, is really selecting a list of connected chemical compound
descriptions. Most of the chemical compounds that are in common use will be
pre-defined and available to any CCPN project; either directly or via
automated download. It is only bespoke or unusual compounds that will need to
be defined by the user and imported. For example the user can import PDB and
mol2 format compound descriptions and import them into CCPN via the
Format Converter.</p>
<p><strong>Molecule Templates</strong></p>
<p>The second major molecular concept in CCPN is the molecule template, which
records a sequence of chemical compounds and how they are linked together. A
template will also record which version of a chemical compound is used, for
example whether a Cys residue is disulphide linked and how acidic and basic
residues are protonated. A molecule template does not directly contain any
atom information, but this is available indirectly by virtue of the template
residues linking to a given chemical compound. As the name suggests, a
molecule template is not the entity that is directly used during the NMR
assignment process; it is just a sequence template that is used to make one or
more molecular systems. If a single chemical compound is going to be used  in
NMR assignment, e.g. a ligand or cofactor, then that compound will still be
used within a molecule template, it is just that the template will only
contain one sequence item/residue.</p>
<p><strong>Molecular Systems</strong></p>
<p>Molecular systems are groups of atoms, residues and chains (protein, DNA
etc..) that are involved in the assignment process. They are constructed
using sequence information from molecule templates and atom information from
the chemical compound descriptions. Molecular systems can be thought of as
representing all of the atoms that are present within an NMR sample or
biolmolecular assembly. If a molecular system is a homo-oligomeric protein
complex, where there are several chains of the same sequence, then the sample
molecule template will be used to generate each of the sub-units, but the
result will be three separate polypeptide chains, and each can be assigned
separately to NMR data. For example the bacteriorhodposin complex is a
homo-trimer, and so to make this complex available in CCPN the user will enter
the sequence of the protein chain once (to make the a template) and then use
the sequence three times to make three chains A, B and C.</p>
<p><strong>Chains Tab</strong></p>
<p>The first tab in the popup window lists all on the assignable molecular chains
that are available in the project. For example if the CCPN project was setup
for a dimer then you might have chain A and chain B listed in a given
molecular system. Here the user can delete chains, if they are not assigned,
and create new chains. There are three basic ways of making chains, the first
is to copy an existing chain, although naturally the user is asked to select a
different identifying chain letter/code to distinguish it from the original.
The second way is to make a chain from an existing molecule template ([Make
Chain From Template]) and the third way is to make a new chain and a new
molecular template at the same time (via [Add Sequence]).</p>
<p>Most commonly, for simple monomeric protein systems, the user will click [Add
Sequence]. After entering a sequence of residue codes, and making sure that a
new molecular system and a new template molecule are to be made, a new
molecular chain is created and ready for assignment. If the molecular system
is more complicated and involves several different chains, then the user may
use [Add Chain] several times for each of the chains within the complex,
making sure that the same destination molecular system is chosen each time.
Alternatively, the user can add all of the template molecules first, and then
make the chains from the template molecules afterwards. This method gives most
flexibility and is recommended if any of the molecules have a non-standard
connectivity or pronation state; this cannot be changed in a template once a
chain has bee created. For example to add insulin, which has two discrete
regions of polypeptide that are disulphide linked, the user would make a
molecule first by adding two polypeptide sections. change the Cys residues to
the disulphide state and make the two disulphide links. Only after the molecule
template definition was complete would the user [Make Chain From Template].</p>
<p>The lower table lists the &#8220;Chain Fragments&#8221; that are present in the  chain
entity selected in the upper table. Each fragment represents a discrete
segment of biopolymer sequence, and although fragments are bound together in
the same chain they are not connected by the usual biopolymer links. For
example insulin will consist of two polypeptide chain fragments that are
connected together by two disulphide bonds. Most of the time however a
biopolymer will consist of only one chain fragment with a continuous backbone.
The starting sequence number of a chain fragment can be edited by the user, as
long as fragments do not overlap numerically. In this way the user can control
the numbering that is present in a chain and thus used in assignment. This
sequence numbering is reversible and can be changed at any time with immediate
effect (although Analysis can be slow to update if there are many
assignments).</p>
<p><strong>Mol Systems Tab</strong></p>
<p>This table list all of the molecular systems within the CCPN projects. These
are used to contain the chains that go together to form a multi-component
complex or NMR sample. The user can add new, empty molecular systems with a
view to adding assignable chains to them at a later time. The user can also
delete a molecular system, and thus all of the chains that it contains, but
only if these chains do not have any assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Sequences Tab</strong></p>
<p>This table is used to list the sequences that are defined within the CCPN
project. The user selects the molecular template in the upper pulldown menu
and the sequence is listed in the table. If a sequence has not been used to
make any chains (in a molecular system) then the sequence can be changed; the
user can adjust the kind of residue at a given position, the compound version
or (descriptor) and how the residue links to others. For example the user
could setup protonation states, disulphide links and join/break sequence
fragments. For a new molecule the user can [Add Polymer] and [Add Compound]
multiple times, thus creating discrete bits of sequence that can be combined
together into a larger molecule. In this way the user could add a polymer
sequence and then a compound representing a cofactor. Alternatively, to
construct insulin [Add Polymer] twice and then [Edit Links] after setting Cys
residue &#8220;descriptors&#8221; to &#8220;link:SG&#8221;.</p>
<p>The [Copy Molecule] function is used to make a new molecule based on the
sequence of an existing one, but this is intended to help add similar
sequences with small differences in residues, protonation states and links.
It is not intended to make identical copies of a molecule; identical copies
are never needed since a single chain can be used multiple times in as many
chains and molecular systems as is required.</p>
<p>The [Lock Molecule] function can be used to prevent any further alteration to
a sequence. Any molecule that has been used to make any chains (for
assignment) will be automatically be locked and cannot be unlocked until its
chains have been deleted. This locking mechanism means that chain any
assignments then may carry cannot be ruined by editing sequences. If the user
genuinely made a mistake in entering a sequence after assignments have already
been made to a chain then the best course of action is to make a new molecule
template, with the correct sequence, a new molecular system, i.e. building
chains using the new template, and copy the assignments from the old molecular
system to the new one via <a class="reference external" href="CopyAssignmentsPopup.html">Copy Assignments</a>; selecting &#8220;Between Molecule
Chains&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Template Molecules Tab</strong></p>
<p>This section lists all of the available sequence templates in the upper table
and a list of the selected molecule&#8217;s attributes in the lower table. The user
can copy, add, extend and delete molecules. Any fine scale editing of the
molecule template should be done via the adjacent &#8220;Sequences&#8221; tab. In keeping
with the above description [Delete Molecule], [Add Polymer Residues] and [Add
Compound] may only be used if a molecule is unlocked and has not been used to
make any chain entities, i.e. in a molecular system. Otherwise the [Add ...]
functions operate in the same way as the equivalent in the &#8220;Sequences&#8221; tab.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>This tab is used to specify how the sequence elements of a molecule template
are connected together. It should be noted that these links can only be edited
if the template in question is not used in any chains and is unlocked (via the
Sequences tab). The general idea is that in the sequences table you select a
template residue and click [Edit Links] or you select the required template
molecule and residue in the pulldown menus in the &#8220;Intra Molecule Links&#8221;
section.</p>
<p>With the required template residue selected the upper table is filled with
rows that represent the covalent links that are, or could be, made from the
selected residue to other &#8220;Destination&#8221; template residues. If the molecule is
unlocked then the user can change or set the residue that is being linked to
by double clicking in the &#8220;Destination Residue&#8221; column and selecting the
required residue option. Note that only template residues that have an
unsatisfied link will be shown as possible targets. If the desired destination
is not free you can go to that residue and remove an existing link (setting
destination to &#8220;&lt;None&gt;&#8221;) before making the required a new one. Most biopolymer
residues will show the &#8220;prev&#8221; and &#8220;next&#8221; connections that represent the
regular backbone connectivity; peptide for proteins, phosphodiester for
nucleic acids. These connections are rarely changed, but can be adjusted to
beak or join a biopolymer. More typically potential side chain and branching
links are adjusted. For example if a Cys amino acid has had its descriptor
set to &#8220;Link:SG&#8221; then an extra type of link will appear in the table. The user
can then connect the SG of the Cys to any other free Cys SG, thus specifying
a disulphide bridge.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Inter Molecule Links&#8221; section is not currently used, but will be filled
in due course.</p>
<p><strong>Add Sequence</strong></p>
<p>This section is used to add new biopolymer sequences to a CCPN project. The
sequence can be used to make a new molecule template, extend an existing
molecule template or make a molecule template and an assignable chain at the
same time. Initially the user should set the required polymer type to  say
what kind of molecule is being made; &#8220;GCAT&#8221; in DNA is different to &#8220;GCAT&#8221; in
protein. Then the user sets whether the sequence will be entered as one-letter
codes or as Ccp codes (often three-letter residue codes). Note that
three-letter codes could be interpreted as one-letter codes without error,
i.e. &#8220;ALA&#8221; could be interpreted as &#8220;Ala, Leu, Ala&#8221; if the one-letter option
was on. Once the sequence is entered correctly the user can switch between the
one-letter and Ccp codes without a problem. The start number sets what the
number of the first residue in the sequence will be, although this can be
changed at any time after. The &#8220;Cyclic&#8221; option means that a biopolymer link
will be made between the first and last residue, e.g. for a protein the amide
which would otherwise be the N-terminus is peptide linked to the last carbonyl
group.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Destination Molecule&#8221; and &#8220;Destination Mol System&#8221; settings are important
because they govern how a sequence will be used in relation to existing
molecular descriptions. If the destination molecule is set to anything
other than &#8220;&lt;New&gt;&#8221; then the system will attempt to add the entered sequence on
to the end of the selected molecule template. This may fail if the selected
template has chains or is otherwise locked. If a new section of sequence is
added to an existing molecule template then the user can adjust how those
template residues are connected to any others via the &#8220;Sequences&#8221; and &#8220;Links&#8221;
tabs. The setting for the destination molecular system dictates whether the
molecule template that the sequence will make (or will extend) is used
immediately to make an assignable chain entity. For adding simple, single
protein chains this is usually the case and the &#8220;Destination Mol System&#8221; is
set to &#8220;&lt;New&gt;&#8221;, although by selecting an existing molecular system the user can
add a new subunit to the specification of a complex. Setting the molecular
system to &#8220;&lt;None&gt;&#8221; allows the user to add a sequence template without making
any chains at all. This is important if the molecule template needs further
adjustment, for example to define non-backbone links or set protonation
states. If the setting was not &#8220;&lt;None&gt;&#8221; and a chain was erroneously made, then
the user should delete the chain in the &#8220;Chains&#8221; tab and [Unlock Molecule] in
the &#8220;Sequences&#8221; tab before making alterations.</p>
<p>The required biopolymer sequence is entered in the &#8220;Sequence Input&#8221; text
panel. Usually this is done by using [Read File] to get the sequence data from
disk, but it is also possible to place sequences into the text area on Linux
systems via the mouse middle button, select-and-paste mechanism. Once sequence
appears in the text area it may be further edited by typing. At any stage the
user may click the [Tidy] function which will number the sequence and arrange
it in neat rows. This also has the helpful effect of checking whether the
sequence is valid and will be interpreted by the CCPN system without error.
Once the sequence is correct and the other settings, including the destination
molecular system, have been checked the clicking the [Add Sequence!] button
commits the sequence by making the specified molecule template and any new
chains.</p>
<p><strong>Small Compounds</strong></p>
<p>Here the user can add small compounds to molecule templates. These may be any
ligands, co-factors, solvents, metabolites etc. that are assignable. Once a
compound had been added to a new or existing molecule template, the compound
can be made accessible for assignment by using its template to create a chain.</p>
<p>Generally the user selects which kind of biopolymer the compound relates to,
or &#8220;other&#8221; of is not associated with any polymer type. In the table on the
right the user scrolls and selects the required chemical compound row. If
idealised atomic coordinates are known for the selected compound these are
displayed in the 3D coordinate display on the left. An absence of such
coordinates does not matter with regard to selecting a compound for
assignment. If a compound row is coloured blue, then the compound is available
locally and may be used immediately. If the row is grey, then the compound will
be downloaded from a remote database before use. Any downloading of this kind
is automatic, but naturally requires an active Internet connection.</p>
<p>Once the desired small molecule is selected the user next selects the required
destination molecule template in the pulldown menu below the table. The
compound can either be put into a new template, i.e. on its own, or added
to an existing molecule, as would normally be done for a covalently linked
cofactor. Finally [Add Compound] actually added the selected
compound to the molecule template. To actually assign to this molecule
the molecule template must be used to make a chain (i.e. in a given molecular
system), which is readily achieved by using the [Make Chain From Template]
function from the &#8220;Chains&#8221; tab.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>In order to delete a chain that carries assignments, the chain must be cleared
of assignments first. The assignments could be moved to a different chain via
the <a class="reference external" href="CopyAssignmentsPopup.html">Copy Assignments</a> system or removed completely. Completely removing a
chain&#8217;s assignments can be done via the <a class="reference external" href="EditSpinSystemPopup.html">Spin Systems</a> or <a class="reference external" href="BrowseResonancesPopup.html">Resonances</a> tables
by selecting the rows that relate to the relevant chain (sorting rows by
residue may help) and then deassigning the spin systems or resonances.</p>
<p>The sequence numbering of a chain can be altered at any stage by editing the
&#8220;Start Seq Number&#8221; in the &#8220;Chain Fragments&#8221; table of the &#8220;Chains&#8221; tab.
Although the start number can be adjusted, currently the residue numbering
will always be sequential within a given fragment. The residue template
numbering in the &#8220;Sequences&#8221; tab cannot be changed, although this may change
in the future. However, the template numbering system is separate from the
chain numbering system.</p>
