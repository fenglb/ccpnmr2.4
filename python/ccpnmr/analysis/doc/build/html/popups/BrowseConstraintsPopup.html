<h1>Structure : Restraints and Violations<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-restraints-and-violations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>Display Structure Restraint and Restraint Violation Data</strong></p>
<p>This popup window is used to manage and display structural restraints. Mostly
such restraints are derived from NMR data and are applied during a structure
calculation to restrict molecular conformations to those which are consistent
with the observed data. Many kinds of NMR data can be used to generate
restraints and the restraints themselves are of different types. This
system will display tables for any kind or restraint described in the CCPN
data model, but the most common kind of restraints are for distances and
dihedral (torsion) angles.</p>
<p>This system is used for viewing and managing restraint information on a large
scale, it is not used directly for the initial generation of the restraints
themselves. Structural restraints may be imported into CCPN via the
<a class="reference external" href="FormatConverter.html">FormatConverter</a> or they may be created with various various dedicated
components available in CCPN software. For example distance restraints may be
made via the <a class="reference external" href="CalcDistConstraintsPopup.html">Make Distance Restraints</a> (using through space experiments like
NOESY) and <a class="reference external" href="MakeHbondRestraintsPopup.html">Make H Bond Restraints</a> options. Dihedral angle restraints can be
made from chemical shift information using <a class="reference external" href="DangleGui.html">DANGLE</a> and from scalar couplings
using the <a class="reference external" href="CalcHnHaCouplingPopup.html">3J H-Ha Coupling</a> option.</p>
<p><strong>Restraint Sets</strong></p>
<p>The first &#8220;Restraint Sets&#8221; tabs lists all of the sets into which the restraint
lists of the project are grouped into. The table indicates how many restraint
and violation lists are in the set as well as an indication of the number of
&#8220;fixed&#8221; resonance assignments that have been frozen in the set. Restraint sets
may be deleted here, but are created elsewhere; when restraint lists are
created they can be put into a new or existing set.</p>
<p>Within CCPN, restraints are stored in restraint lists which group together
restraints of the same type (i.e. angle and distance restraints cannot be
mixed in a list). Restraint lists are further grouped together into restraint
sets. A restraint set often represents all of the restraint lists that will be
used together at the same time during a structure calculation. However, this
grouping is slightly more subtle because a restraint set has important
consequences with regards to NMR resonance assignment. In essence, a restraint
set takes a fixed snapshot of the resonance assignment status at the time the
restraints were made. Consequently, if atomic assignments change after
restraints are generated the restraints will remain linked to the original
atoms. This is helpful to the user because it is always possible to know what
was actually restrained in a structure calculation. The user should however be
careful when putting new restraints into old restraint sets; if atom
assignments have changed then even the new restraints (actually between NMR
resonances) will still restrain the old atom assignments. Thus it is good
practice to always make a new restraint set if assignments have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Restraint Lists</strong></p>
<p>The second &#8220;Restraint Lists&#8221; tab displays all of the restraint lists that are
available in the selected restraint set. The restraint set may be selected in
the pulldown menu above the tabs. Generally this table is used to give an
overview of the restraint lists but several high-level functions are
accessible via the buttons below the table. As described above, the actual
restraint generation takes place elsewhere in dedicated systems.</p>
<p>Restraint lists my be deleted and merged/combined together into a single list
(if they are of the same type). It is notable that restraint lists may  also
be split. Currently there are two means of doing this, the first is to [Split
Ambig/Unambig] which separates a distance restraint list into two, where one
list contains only restraints that are equivalent to a single assignment (only
two linked atoms or prochiral sets) and the other list has restraints that
represent multiple, ambiguous assignments. The [Split Violated] function is
helpful during violation analyses, which aim to determine which restraints are
incompatible (e.g. mistaken assignment, minor conformation or artifact) with a
structural model. This will separate out a list of those restraints that are
violated in a structure (beyond the restraint bounds) for further inspection.</p>
<p><strong>Restraints</strong></p>
<p>The third &#8220;Restraints&#8221; tab allows the user to view all of the individual
restraints within a restraint list, selected via the left hand &#8220;Restraint
List&#8221; pulldown. If any structure violation analyses have been performed on the
list the user can select from the &#8220;Violation List&#8221; pulldown. Any restraints
that  were violated in the structural analysis will be coloured; red, orange
or yellow depending on severity. Also where violations are recorded the
columns for &#8220;Mean Viol&#8221;; average violation amount over a structure ensemble,
and &#8220;Viol Fraction&#8221;; the proportion of an ensemble&#8217;s models that were violated,
are filled.</p>
<p>Selecting from the &#8220;Structure&#8221; pulldown menu allows geometric information to
be extracted from a structure ensemble, so that it may be compared with the
values that are being restrained. Accordingly, if a structure violation
analysis is performed using [Calculate Violations] then it is the selected
structure that is compared with the restraints to find inconsistencies. Also,
selecting as structure allows the &#8220;Struc Value&#8221; column to be filled with the
value calculated from the resonance locations in the structure. Here   the kind
of value naturally differs according to which type of restraint  list is
displayed.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Value Method&#8221; pulldown menu is notable for distance restraints because it
allows the user to switch between &#8220;NOE sum&#8221; and &#8220;Minimum&#8221; options. These are
relevant because a restraint, which restrains pairs of resonances, may link
groups that contain multiple atoms (e.g. a methyl group). With multiple atoms
at the end of a distance restraint there is flexibility about how the distance
is defined. The &#8220;Minimum&#8221; method to measuring distances simply records the
shortest distance between any pair of atoms from either side of the restraint
(e.g. the closes atoms in two methyls). The &#8220;NOE sum&#8221; method uses r^-6
distance summation to give a value that represents what the equivalent NOE
estimated distance would be if a signal were recorded between the two atom
groups. For example, if a restraint is to a methyl group all three methyl
atoms will contribute to increase the intensity of an NOE signal, so the
distance will appear to <em>shorter</em> than the single atom equivalent. Hence it is
this shorter distance that will come from the NMR data and appear in the
restraint, and thus the shorter distance that should be used in violation
analyses. The get the &#8220;NOE sum&#8221; distance the pairs of atom distances
are first converted into a kind of &#8216;NOE intensity&#8217; (r^-6), these are added
together to give the total &#8216;NOE intensity&#8217;, which is then converted back
into a distance.</p>
<p>In the main restraints table the restrains are listed as coloured rows, but
there will often be grey rows present. A grey row represents an alternative
set of restrained resonances (e.g. a different pair of atoms) but relates to
the same restrained value. The main coloured row for a restraint and the grey
alternatives are both referred to as the &#8220;items&#8221; for the restraint. Hence at
the bottom there is the [Delete Items] button to remove specific restraint
alternatives. In this regard there is no difference between the first green
item and the other possibilities; it is fairly arbitrary which item comes
first. Naturally deleting all of the items (possibilities) in a restraint
removes the whole restraint. Although the first item is often coloured green
it may have other colours indicating a structural violation. A restraint with
more than one item may reflect either a genuine signal overlap, e.g. an NOE
peak is caused by two or more close atom pairs that have similar chemical
shifts and cannot be separated, or ambiguous trial assignments that come from
speculatively matching chemical shifts to spectrum peaks.</p>
<p>The various functions below the table allow restraints to be managed but the
restrained resonances, and the parameter values they relate, to come from
specialised restraint generation systems. In general the restraint information
is derived from NMR experimentation and not adjusted by hand, Several functions
allow the user to link between the restraints and any spectrum peaks that they
are derived from. This can be done after selecting restraints with [Show
Peaks] or after selecting peaks with [Show Restraints For Selected Peaks].
There are also functions to coordinate assignments between the restraints and
peaks. How this is done in practice tends to vary with personal preference,
but it is possible to both refresh a restraint according to the latest peak
assignment with [Update Assignment From Peak] or refresh the peaks according
to the restraints (e.g. after an ARIA or CYANA run that removes restraint
ambiguity) with [Update Peak Assignments].</p>
<p><strong>Violation Lists</strong></p>
<p>The forth &#8220;Violation Lists&#8221; tab gives details of all of the violation analyses
that have been recorded in the project. Strictly speaking, each violation list
can contain results from several analyses but this is usually not the case in
normal Analysis operation. The individual violation records are presented in
the last &#8220;Violations&#8221; tab, and also  affect the violation data presented in
the &#8220;Restraints&#8221; table. Violation lists may be calculated, given a structure
and a restraint list, inside Analysis using [Calculate Violations] in the
&#8220;Restraints&#8221; tab, or they may be imported from external programs like ARIA.</p>
<p>A violation list is a grouping of violation entities, and these record an
inconsistency between the restrained values of a restraint and what is
actually observed in a structure (or ensemble). Essentially this means a
structural value is outside the bonds of the restraint. Clicking on a
violation list in the upper table will fill the lower table with an overview
of the structure models that were used in the restraint violation analysis
(usually just a single ensemble).</p>
<p><strong>Violations</strong></p>
<p>The last tab lists all of the violation items that were recorded in a
selected violation list. This table will present some of the same information
as the &#8220;Restraints&#8221; tab, if a violation list is selected there. The data is
merely presented in a different way. Selecting a specific row in the table
allows the user to [Show Restraint], to view the restraint that was violated
in the &#8220;Restraints&#8221; tab. Other functions allow the user to jump to the peak,
that gave rise to the restraint, which may be the underlying source of the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats &amp; Tips</strong></p>
<p>Having large restraint sets in a CCPN project can make loading the CCPN data
into Analysis slow, and takes up more memory. Thus it is advisable to delete
any restraint sets that are no longer in use,</p>
<p>If the restraint table is slow to update, consider switching off any structure
selection. Extracting values from large structure ensembles can take a
noticeable amount of time.</p>
<p>The [Calculate Violations] function will not work until a Structure is
selected.</p>
<p>Although the CCPN violation analysis tries to do a good job it can never be
exactly the same as analyses performed during a structure calculation. Most of
the reason for this is due to the stereo-specific resolution of prochiral
atoms. For example, Analysis can only determine which of HBa or HBb atoms
actually goes with the HB2 or HB3 sites by taking a poll (based on minimising
violation) after the structure calculation is complete, and this prochiral
resolution may differ from what actually occurred in the calculation
(minimising energy).</p>
