  **Print Window to Output File**

  The purpose of this dialog is to allow the saving of the window
  to a file, in one of the following formats: PostScript (PS),
  Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) or Portable Document Format (PDF).

  At its simplest to print out a window you just need to specify the
  File name, and then click "Save".  But it is likely you will at the
  very least want to change some of the other settings.

  You can specify a Title and a label for the X axis and/or Y axis
  (although these might not make sense dependent on the context).

  You can also specify the Paper size (default A4), the
  Orientation of the paper (default Portrait), whether the printout
  is Color or Black and white (the Style, default Color), and what
  the Format is (PS, EPS or PDF, default PS).

  How the window fits into the paper is determined by the Scaling
  option.  The Percentage option just means that the window is
  scaled by that amount relative to the biggest size it could be and
  still fit on the paper.  The remaining options are if you want to
  specify the cms or inches per unit (normally ppm), or the inverse
  of these.  In this case it could be the case that the window
  actually exceeds the size of the paper.

  You can also include the Time and Date and/or the File Name in the
  printout, and you can specify the font used for this.  The same
  font is used for the Title and X and Y axis labels, except that
  the Title font is 6 pts bigger.
